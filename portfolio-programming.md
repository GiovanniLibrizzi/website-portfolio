<h3 class="inline"><a href="https://guessthe.band">Guess the Band</a></h3><p class="inline"><i> ~ (React, Javascript, Node.js, MySQL)</i></p>

A daily trivia web app where where you decipher a new band everyday based on the provided clues

- Inspired by daily trivia games such as Wordle, NYT Connections, Guess the Game, and catfishing.net
- Each guess reveals more information about today's selected band, with up to 6 guesses possible
- Uses a React front-end to process user input, serve clues, and manage user guesses
- MySQL is used to store band data and user guess statistics, utilizing foreign keys and joins to ensure database normalization
- Created a REST API with Node.js and Express.js that is used to fetch and post data to the server

<h3 class="inline">Code Flowchart Tutoring Software</h3><p class="inline"><i> ~ (Java, SQL)</i></p>

Collaborated with a team of 5 to develop software that allows students to build flowcharts based on code problems and compare to known solutions in a database

- I developed flowchart building functionality for the user and also wrote an algorithm to detect incorrect flowcharts based on the correct solution stored in the database
- I wrote code that serializes our custom flowchart data structures into JSON to use in our database
- Our team used Taiga and Git to work in an Agile/Scrum process, where we tracked biweekly sprints with user stories and issues, as well as doing biweekly standups to our project supervisor
- I also helped test out other developers' implementations and wrote test cases to ensure their functionality

Created a backend system for a mock-up game purchasing platform using Python and MySQL using a full dataset from Steam's game databases, including game expansions

- Parsed, processed, and cleaned 100,000+ lines of real data from Steam's game database
- Allowed users to search, purchase, and refund from over 100,000 products efficiently
- Used normalized databases linked together by primary and foreign keys
- Managed account logins and creation with salted and hashed passwords
